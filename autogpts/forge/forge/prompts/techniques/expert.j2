# This function, `calculate_average`, takes a list of numbers as an argument.
# The function calculates the average of the numbers in the list by summing them up
# and dividing by the length of the list. It then returns the calculated average.
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Initialize the sum of numbers to 0
    total = 0

    # Loop through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the total
        total += num

    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements in the list
    average = total / len(numbers)

    # Return the calculated average
    return average
