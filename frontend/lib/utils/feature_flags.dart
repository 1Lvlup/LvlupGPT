// This is the FeatureFlags class, which contains a set of static constants
// that represent various feature flags for the application. Each feature
// flag is a boolean value that can be enabled or disabled.
//
// In this example, the FeatureFlags class contains a single feature flag
// named `userExperienceIterationTwoEnabled`. This flag represents whether
// or not the second iteration of the application's user experience is
// enabled. Currently, this flag is set to false, indicating that the second
// iteration of the user experience is disabled.
