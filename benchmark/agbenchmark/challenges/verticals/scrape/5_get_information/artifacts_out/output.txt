# This is a Python script that uses the FanaHOVA library to generate a face recognition model.

import FanaHOVA

# Initialize the FanaHOVA library
fana = FanaHOVA.FanaHOVA()

# Load the training dataset
fana.loadTrainingDataset("training_data.csv")

# Train the face recognition model
fana.trainModel()

# Save the trained model to a file

# This is a simple function that uses the trained model to recognize a face in an image.

    # Print the recognition result
