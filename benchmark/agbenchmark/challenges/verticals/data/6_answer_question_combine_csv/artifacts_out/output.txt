# Get user input
# The 'input' function is used to prompt the user for a number.
# The 'float' function is used to convert the user input into a floating point number.
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Calculate the square
# The '**' operator is used to calculate the square of a number.
# In this case, the square of 'num' is calculated and assigned to the variable 'square'.
square = num ** 2

# Print the result with proper formatting
# The 'print' function is used to output the result to the console.
# The 'f' string notation is used to format the output with the desired number of decimal places.
print(f"The square of {num:.2f} is {square:.2f}.")
# Specifically, the number stored in 'num' is formatted to display two decimal places,
# and the same is done for the number stored in 'square'.
